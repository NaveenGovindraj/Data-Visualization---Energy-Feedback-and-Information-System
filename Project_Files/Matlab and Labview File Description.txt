Note: Not able to upload the matlab file as the MATLAB file exceeds the limitations for upload. But this project can be utilized with any matlab file (*.mat) and matlab simulink file as well. the users need to change the parameters in the labview file accordingly.

User Interface design is implemented by using data from real-time excavator measurements, and visualized using LabVIEW. 

The excavator measurements or the data source which can be utilized is a Matlab file or a Matlab Simulink model.


This Labview User interface is integarted with matlab by which the user interface facilitates the user to make the interlink between the UI and the Matlab file.

The data extracted from the matlab or the simulink file is visualized is a more human readable form.
